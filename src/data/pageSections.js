        description: "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like all the other oscilloscope programs, this works by taking point arrays and building wave files with them, which are played out of a computer's auxiliary jack and channeled into the X and Y axes of the oscilloscope (in X-Y mode). I think it looks way better on an analog oscilloscope, but it also works fine on a digital one.",
