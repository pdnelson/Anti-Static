        description: "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you ever wanted to play Blackjack with a friend using your computer, but you couldn't, because you couldn't trust them to not peek at the computer screen? I haven't, but this program aims to solve that problem for those who have! All you need to do is grab your oscilloscope and run this program! Finally, an accessible solution for every Blackjack enthusiast!<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The \"house\" will be using the computer, and the \"player\" will be looking at the oscilloscope. There is an overlay (made from a whoopie pie wrapper) to tell the user what each value means.<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was designed during, and presented at YCP's 2019 three-day Hackathon. The Devpost post can be found <a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/blackjack-but-finally-playable-with-one-monitor\">here</a>, if you're curious.  Unfortunately, I lost the source code to this when I was purging files on my laptop, and never made a copy on my desktop, otherwise I would have a link for it here. :(<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like all the other oscilloscope programs, this works by taking point arrays and building wave files with them, which are played out of a computer's auxiliary jack and channeled into the X and Y axes of the oscilloscope (in X-Y mode). I think it looks way better on an analog oscilloscope, but it also works fine on a digital one.",
